There are several files for developing sentiment analysis models in Basque. I add a trainning, test, and validation files for such purposes. All utterances are labeled as positive (1), negative (-1), or neutral (0). The root of the dataset was retrieved from BasqueGLUE, which was latter expanded with 1,000 tweets. The dataset has been used for several purposes, including Basque word embeddings.
